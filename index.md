# OBLIVION Project

## Overview

The OBLIVION project has evolved significantly since its inception, inspired by the iconic brooch featured in the *Oblivion* movie. What began as a passion project to recreate a memorable piece of cinematic fashion has transformed into an advanced endeavor, integrating modern technology with sophisticated design. The project now stands at version 1.43, boasting numerous enhancements including the use of apa102 2020 LEDs, an ATtiny microcontroller for nuanced control, custom PCB designs for both the case and the badge, and an innovative magnetic fixation mechanism.

## Evolution of the Project

### Initial Concept and Prototype

The project started with a simple vision: to recreate the metallic brooch from *Oblivion*, enhanced with LED functionality for a modern twist. The initial prototype, Version 0.1, featured charlieplexing white LEDs on a single PCB, laying the foundation for future enhancements.

### Progression to Version 1.43

Over time, the project underwent multiple revisions, each adding new features and refining the design:

- **Integration of APA102 2020 LEDs:** The shift to APA102 2020 RGB LEDs marked a significant upgrade, offering vibrant, customizable lighting and enhanced visual appeal.

- **Microcontroller Implementation:** The incorporation of an ATtiny microcontroller allowed for sophisticated control over the LED effects, enabling a range of lighting modes and interactions.

- **Custom PCB Designs:** The evolution from a single PCB to custom designs for both the case and the badge facilitated a sleeker, more refined aesthetic. The case PCB was designed in-house and sent to a manufacturer for the badge, ensuring professional quality and durability.

- **Magnetic Fixation Mechanism:** Moving away from traditional attachment methods, the project introduced a magnetic fixation system for the badge, enhancing wearability and convenience.

### Refined Design and Manufacture

The culmination of these developments is a brooch that not only closely replicates the original movie prop but also stands on its own as a modern, technologically advanced accessory. The design has been carefully refined, with a focus on minimalism and elegance, and the manufacturing process streamlined to produce a high-quality, durable product.

### Current Version: 1.43 Highlights

- **APA102 2020 LEDs for vibrant, customizable colors**
- **ATtiny microcontroller for complex lighting modes**
- **Home-made PCB for the case and professionally manufactured PCB for the badge**
- **Magnetic fixation for easy attachment and removal**

## Continuous Improvement

The OBLIVION project is a testament to the power of iterative design and the pursuit of perfection. With each version, from the initial prototype to the latest 1.43 release, the project has embraced new technologies and design philosophies to create an accessory that is not only a tribute to its cinematic inspiration but also a beacon of modern wearable technology.

## Future Directions

As the OBLIVION project continues to evolve, future versions will explore further advancements in technology and design, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with wearable tech inspired by the world of cinema.
