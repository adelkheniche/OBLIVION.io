## Introduction

Inspired by the captivating design of a metallic brooch from the movie *Oblivion*, the OBLIVION LED Brooch Project has grown from a simple idea into a sophisticated piece of wearable technology. Now at version 1.43, this project blends the aesthetic appeal of the original prop with modern electronics, including apa102 2020 RGB LEDs, an ATtiny microcontroller for dynamic lighting control, and innovative design techniques for both aesthetics and functionality.

The OBLIVION LED Brooch Project began with the objective of creating a wearable piece inspired by the *Oblivion* movie, integrating an ATtiny microcontroller for LED control. This initial step was crucial for embedding technology into a compact accessory.

#### Microelectronics and PCB Design

### Starting Point

The initial phase of the OBLIVION LED Brooch Project was focused on acquiring new skills and overcoming technical challenges related to working with miniature electronics, specifically the APA102 2020 LEDs.

#### Learning Custom PCB Fabrication and Soldering

- **APA102 2020 LED Integration:** The project began with the goal of integrating APA102 2020 LEDs into the brooch design. These LEDs are known for their small size, making them ideal for compact projects but challenging to work with due to the precision required in soldering and PCB design.

- **Custom PCB Design:** The initial step was designing a PCB for the APA102 2020 LEDs, which were new to me. To test their functionality and connectivity, I made a breakout board. This involved using a CNC 1418 to produce PCBs with fine traces, necessary for accurately mounting the LEDs. This approach helped in verifying the design before proceeding with manufacturing, aiming to save time and money.

- **Soldering Challenges:** Given the small size of the APA102 2020 LEDs, traditional soldering methods were not feasible. To address this, a sitelamp was modified to serve as a soldering plate. This adaptation allowed for the precise control of temperature needed to solder such small components successfully.

This initial stage was about mastering the skills necessary for the project, including custom PCB design for tiny components and developing a method to solder them reliably.

## Evolution to Version 1.43

From its inception, the project evolved through multiple iterations, leading to version 1.43. Each update brought enhancements in design, functionality, and user experience, reflecting a straightforward progression in the project's development.

### Advancements to Version 1.43

As the project advanced, each version introduced new features, improved design, and more sophisticated technology, culminating in version 1.43, which boasts:

- **APA102 2020 RGB LEDs:** For bright, customizable colors and patterns.
- **ATtiny Microcontroller:** Enables complex control schemes for the LEDs, allowing for a variety of lighting effects.
- **Custom PCB Designs:** Separate PCBs for the case and the badge enhance the design's sleekness and functionality. The case's PCB is home-made, while the badge's PCB is professionally manufactured.
- **Magnetic Fixation:** A novel approach to attaching the brooch, offering ease of use without compromising the garment.

### Design and Manufacturing

The project's design has evolved to a more refined aesthetic, maintaining the minimalist appeal of the original concept while integrating modern technology seamlessly. The use of a homemade PCB for the case and a professional-grade PCB for the badge ensures durability and quality, while the magnetic fixation system offers a user-friendly experience.

## Highlights of Version 1.43

This version represents a significant milestone in the project's development, featuring:

- **Enhanced LED Lighting:** Utilizing apa102 2020 RGB LEDs for vibrant and dynamic color patterns.
- **Sophisticated Control:** An ATtiny microcontroller provides advanced programming capabilities for customizable lighting effects.
- **Innovative Design:** The sleek, minimal design is achieved through custom PCBs and a magnetic fixation system, blending aesthetics with functionality.
- **Quality Manufacturing:** A combination of homemade and professionally manufactured components ensures a high-quality final product.

## Looking Ahead

  After much reflection and learning through the development of the OBLIVION LED Brooch Project, I've come to the decision not to pursue further enhancements under its current guise. The journey has been rich with lessons, from successful implementations to valuable mistakes. While the project as a brooch may not embody the pinnacle of originality or value I initially hoped for, the experience has undoubtedly set the groundwork for future endeavors.

There's a part of me that yearns to perfect this project, yet I question the merit in doing so, considering its perceived value. Should there be a next iteration or a new project altogether, it will likely pivot from the limitations encountered here, such as the integration of touch sensors, which the ATtiny84 cannot accommodate. A different microcontroller, like the AT1616 with built-in touch sensing capabilities, would be more apt for such advancements.

This doesn't mark the end of my exploration in blending technology with design but rather a strategic pause, as I contemplate the best use of the knowledge gained from this venture for future creations..
