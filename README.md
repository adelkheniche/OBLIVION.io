The OBLIVION LED Brooch Project began with the objective of creating a wearable piece inspired by the *Oblivion* movie, integrating an ATtiny microcontroller for LED control. This initial step was crucial for embedding technology into a compact accessory.

#### Microelectronics and PCB Design

### Starting Point

The initial phase of the OBLIVION LED Brooch Project was focused on acquiring new skills and overcoming technical challenges related to working with miniature electronics, specifically the APA102 2020 LEDs.

#### Learning Custom PCB Fabrication and Soldering![PXL_20210723_194000389](https://github.com/adelkheniche/OBLIVION/assets/12121516/87372f12-c1b3-4a50-87aa-5af7491aa6e1)


- **APA102 2020 LED Integration:** The project began with the goal of integrating APA102 2020 LEDs into the brooch design. These LEDs are known for their small size, making them ideal for compact projects but challenging to work with due to the precision required in soldering and PCB design.

- **Custom PCB Design:** The initial step was designing a PCB for the APA102 2020 LEDs, which were new to me. To test their functionality and connectivity, I made a breakout board. This involved using a CNC 1418 to produce PCBs with fine traces,

- **Soldering Challenges:** Given the small size of the APA102 2020 LEDs, traditional soldering methods were not feasible. To address this, a sitelamp was modified to serve as a soldering plate. This adaptation allowed for the precise control of temperature needed to solder such small components successfully.

## Looking Ahead

  After much reflection and learning through the development of the OBLIVION LED Brooch Project, I've come to the decision not to pursue further enhancements under its current guise. The journey has been rich with lessons, from successful implementations to valuable mistakes. While the project as a brooch may not embody the pinnacle of originality or value I initially hoped for, the experience has undoubtedly set the groundwork for future endeavors.

There's a part of me that yearns to perfect this project, yet I question the merit in doing so, considering its perceived value. Should there be a next iteration or a new project altogether, it will likely pivot from the limitations encountered here, such as the integration of touch sensors, which the ATtiny84 cannot accommodate. A different microcontroller, like the AT1616 with built-in touch sensing capabilities, would be more apt for such advancements.

This doesn't mark the end of my exploration in blending technology with design but rather a strategic pause, as I contemplate the best use of the knowledge gained from this venture for future creations..
